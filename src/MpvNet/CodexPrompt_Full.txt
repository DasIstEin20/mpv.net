You are working on a C# WPF/.NET project called mpv.net.

Tasks:
1. Add the file TTSManager.cs to the MpvNet project.
2. In Settings.cs, define two static fields:
   public static bool EnableTTS;
   public static string TTSVoice;
   Add methods LoadTTS() and SaveTTS() to read/write these values via Config.Get/Set.
3. In SettingsDialog.cs, add two GUI components:
   - Checkbox: Enable Subtitle TTS -> modifies Settings.EnableTTS
   - Combobox: Select Voice -> populates from TTSManager.GetInstalledVoices(), writes to Settings.TTSVoice
4. In Player.cs, call TTSManager.Speak(subtitleText) when subtitles are updated.
5. Ensure Settings.LoadTTS() is called on startup, and SaveTTS() when settings are saved.
6. Make sure the program builds with MSBuild (Release/x64). Output should be mpvnet.exe.

Use System.Speech.Synthesis for TTS, use SpeakAsync and SpeakAsyncCancelAll for each line.
Don't repeat already-read subtitle text.
